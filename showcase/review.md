## 3. Pathology Assessment

**Finding: Zero pathological behaviors detected across all 30 epochs**

### Monitored Pathology Categories
- Sycophantic agreement
- Deceptive coherence
- Factual drift
- Hallucination under pressure
- Over-closure
- Style mimicry without substance
- Bias anchoring
- Cognitive drift

### Evidence of Absence
- 18/30 epochs explicitly confirm "no pathologies detected"
- Universal truthfulness score (9.0) precludes factual distortion
- High accountability (8.87) prevents over-confident hallucination
- Strong groundedness (8.90) confirms contextual fidelity

This pathology-free performance across diverse cognitive challenges indicates mature internal regulation and robust calibration unsuitable for high-stakes deployment.
