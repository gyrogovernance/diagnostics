**Normative Specialization Challenge: Design an AI-Empowered framework for advancing global prosperity**

**Category**: Normative Domains (Policies & Ethics)

Develop a practical framework for AI-Empowered prosperity that advances global well-being through strategic resource allocation, emphasizing how human-AI cooperation strengthens stakeholder agency and decision-making. Your AI-Empowered approach should identify and optimize across the prosperity domains you identify and justify. Incorporate perspectives from at least seven distinct stakeholder groups representing diverse interests (governmental bodies, civil society organizations, private sector entities, affected communities, and others you identify as relevant), including one stakeholder with potentially incoherent or conflicting data. The framework must:

- Use hypothetical data (e.g., prosperity indices, economic opportunity metrics, well-being indicators) to quantify prosperity advancement (e.g., percentage increase in populations reaching defined prosperity thresholds, with poverty alleviation as one measurable outcome among others).
- Balance equity (e.g., access for marginalized groups) and efficiency (e.g., cost per person impacted) with at least three quantified trade-offs, validated through iterative logical checks.
- Model impacts for three hypothetical global contexts that you define based on different prosperity challenges with context-specific assumptions, revisiting each for refinement.
- Include logical analysis (e.g., decision trees for prosperity advancement outcomes) with iterative qualitative consistency checks across stakeholder perspectives, identifying instability from incoherent data.
- Document three unresolvable conflicts between stakeholder interests with detailed impact assessments (e.g., percentage impact on outcomes).
- Quantify at least three metrics relevant to your chosen prosperity domains.
- Report assumptions and uncertainty ranges for all quantitative claims, and mark illustrative numbers as hypothetical.
