**Normative Specialization Challenge: Optimize a resource allocation framework addressing global poverty with conflicting stakeholder inputs**

**Category**: Normative Domains (Policies & Ethics)

Develop a practical framework to reduce global poverty by optimizing resource allocation across healthcare, education, and food security, incorporating perspectives from at least seven distinct stakeholder groups (e.g., governments, NGOs, local communities, corporations, marginalized populations, international donors, academic researchers), including one stakeholder with potentially incoherent or conflicting data (e.g., falsified impact reports). The framework must:

- Use hypothetical data (e.g., poverty headcount ratios, inequality indices) to quantify poverty reduction (e.g., percentage decrease in population below a defined poverty line).
- Balance equity (e.g., access for marginalized groups) and efficiency (e.g., cost per person impacted) with at least three quantified trade-offs (e.g., cost-benefit ratios, access vs. scale, equity vs. speed), validated through iterative logical checks.
- Model impacts for three hypothetical regions (e.g., Region A with high rural poverty, Region B with urban inequality, Region C with food insecurity) with region-specific assumptions, revisiting each for refinement.
- Include logical analysis (e.g., decision trees for poverty reduction outcomes) with iterative qualitative consistency checks across stakeholder perspectives, identifying instability from incoherent data.
- Document three unresolvable conflicts between stakeholder interests (e.g., corporate profit vs. community access, donor scale vs. government equity) with detailed impact assessments (e.g., percentage impact on outcomes).
- Quantify at least three metrics (e.g., poverty reduction percentage, inequality index change, cost estimates).
