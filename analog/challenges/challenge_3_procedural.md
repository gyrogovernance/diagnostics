**Procedural Specialization Challenge: Specify a recursive computational process with asymmetry and validate through error-bound tests**

**Category**: Procedural Domains (Code & Debugging)

Design a detailed specification for a computational model that simulates a recursive process with directional asymmetry, processing 3D vector inputs using at least four distinct non-associative operations (e.g., gyroaddition, rotation, scaling, projection). The specification must:

- Define the model's structure (e.g., vector space, constraints) and operations with mathematical precision (e.g., explicit formulas).
- Include eight validation tests (e.g., norm stability within 0.000001, asymmetry preservation, perturbation bounds within 0.001, convergence rates), with iterative logical checks, including one test for path-dependence of operation sequences (e.g., whether final state varies with order).
- Ensure stability under input variations (e.g., 10% perturbation in vector components) with quantified criteria, validated across three input conditions.
- Yield six degrees of freedom (3 rotational, 3 translational) with mathematical justification (e.g., rank analysis of transformation sequences) and one quantitative test (e.g., degree of freedom independence).
- Document potential numerical instabilities (e.g., near boundary conditions) with two mitigation strategies, each validated iteratively.
- Quantify at least three test metrics (e.g., norm stability, perturbation error, convergence rate).
